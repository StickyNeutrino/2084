## Overview

Below is an outline of a science fiction short story that centers around ideas from NLP.
I thought it would be cool to explore how NLP could be used in a dystopian future.
It is set in a world similar to that in the novel 1984, where conflict has lead to authoritarian nations that closely monitor the thoughts and ideas of the population.
One character, 'Tads Rand', is a government investigator in charge of finding concepts and ideas the state has determined 'dangerous'. The other, 'Devin Otia', is a revolutionary who uses similar tools to evade capture and conceal their activity.

## World

### Setting
In the mid 21st century, for the first time since the cold war, technological progress had once again began to threaten the foundation of large scale human civilization.
Although predicted since the 20th century, breakthroughs in artificial general intelligence never materialized.
Instead, slow and directed progress in the area of narrow intelligence yielded tools of ever higher precision and power.
Beginning as tools, these systems soon grew into weapons that the technological societies were simply unequipped to survive.

The ability to create large amounts of fake media lead to truth and consensus becoming near impossible to find.
It became possible for any person to produce an amount of content that used to require entire propaganda ministries.
People began to separate into strange sects and groups that held increasingly different views, united only in their distrust for outsiders.
Crimes became increasingly difficult to prosecute as all defendants could easily claim evidence is fabricated or even fabricate exonerating evidence.
As the years passed distrust grew until eventually society got to its breaking point, and sometime in the mid 2040s it snapped.

The period of wars, famine and confusion that followed left the world shattered.
By the time of the collapse most nations were technological developed enough to be affected.
Populations were left supriseingly able to be influenced and directed.
Nations were torn apart over increasingly strange and trivial ideas amplified to nation scale.
Even those less developed were severely harmed by the breakdown of global trade and trust.

There is still no world consensus on what even generally took place between the mid 2040s and 60s, many people believe there will never be one.
Strangely, most of history of the early 21st century and before is still known and is moderately uncontroversial.
Historical artifacts and physical evidence support claims made about it.
However, as the world became more digital, it started to leave less and less indisputable evidence to cooperate any claim.
What is know however, is that eventually in the late 60s the world began to stabilize again.
New societies and nations were finally able to reform and begin to rebuild what had been lost.

The two main characters live in a country in the same geographic area as the United States.
It is asserted in official history that this nation is still the same one founded in the 18th century.
Only in the most passing of thoughts would it be safe to even consider questioning this claim.
### Technology

#### Mass Surveillance
The maintenance of proper thought and consensus becomes a central focus of governments.
So much so that passive surveillance is no longer deemed sufficient.
Instead, the United States as most other nations has a mandatory 'public engagement' system.
On the surface quite similar to social media, the government sponsored Giggil is anything but.
Engagement with the platform is measured and prolonged inactivity is a crime.

Every post is scrutinized and analyzed.
Any form of encryption has long been outlawed, all thoughts in writing and many said out-loud are recorded and searchable by government agents.
Any form of automated activity is also a crime and so citizens are expected to spend an hour a day on the platform.
It's an open secret the government has automated accounts, working their way into social circles and friendships.

Designed as a sort of panopticon, the automated systems are always watching and their capabilities are state secrets.
The primary purpose is actually to find persons interacting with information or ideas from other nations.
It's known they look for similarity, similarity of style, similarity of subject.
Most people only have superstitious ideas about what is being looked for.
You never know what correlation might give your crime away.
Anything from simply using a phrase from a forbidden text or writing in a similar style is enough.
The old 'beyond a reasonable doubt' has been rigorously defined as a false positive rate of 1 in 2^30.
The requirement that the justification be understandable by a human jury has been abolished.
Laws are now written expecting to be automatically enforced according to Bayes' theorem.

#### Stenography
Even with encryption outlawed and secret communication a crime, those who wish to hold illegal ideas have found ways to communicate.
With all communication monitored, any illegal message must appear to be some other legal one.
Additionally, since a person's entire activity is monitored, the message has to make sense in that persons context.
Many people have heard rumors that there are tools that do this, but many think they are urban legend.

Building these tools is a group known as the Standard Deviation.
They are constantly locked in a game of cat and mouse with the government agents attempting to defeat both them and the systems they create.
Danger is one mistake away, and even the smallest error will be noticed by the machines.

However, the government not only controls all communication but also most sources of information.
It is impossible to know what pages or profiles are run by the government.
Anyone generating messages must take care to not be obviously trying to match publicly available text, as it may have been manipulated in-order to identify someone trying too hard to stick in.
It is an interesting problem to consider how to train a algorithm to blend in if its hard to collect large amounts of 'normal' data.

#### Idea Tracking
One of the central goals of this system of surveillance is the ability to track and control the flow of ideas in society.
Within government agencies there is the concept of an idea vector.
Illegal ideas are those that are within a certain similarity of those that have been deemed illegal.
Tracking the flow of certain types of these idea vectors through the population is the job of several government agencies.


Most of the time the system automatically handles the spread of illegal or unwanted ideas.
But human agents are still used for investigating specific incidents where there is not enough information for the system to decide.
An agent can view which ideas a person was likely exposed to or has been considering recently.

## Characters

### Tads Rand
#### Background
Born as nations began to stabilize, he believes the current system is the only way to avoid another such time-period.
A government agent, he is tasked with tracking down information or ideas related to stenography or concealing intention.
Starting as a junior investigator, his record quickly reflected his exceptional aptitude.
Climbing through the ranks he eventually finds himself on the tail of an entity thinks to be distributing means to conceal ideas.

#### The case
This new method seems to evade any form of automated classification.
Worse yet it seems to be getting more popular.
Usually this would lead to more samples and thus better classifiers.
However, for groups using this method, they were not generalizing for more then a day or two.
Some groups using it did seem to stop abruptly occasionally, though no records seemed to mention arrests.

### Devin Otia  

#### Background
A computer programer working at a small engineering firm.
Being older than Tads, Devin's parents remembered well the world before 2040.
The way they talked about conversation and freedom left an impression on him.
This led him to eventually become connected with a member of the Standard Deviation.
He became a secret expert in ways to hide messages in the natural frequencies and placement of words.

#### The artifact
Devin had only ever interacted with two entities from the Standard Deviation.
He thought of them only as entity A and entity B, associating a name would be dangerous.
Entity A was the first one he contacted, and both had only been contacted rarely.
B sent a message decoded to a strange piece of software, with instructions not to run it.
Bot A and B disappeared after that.
